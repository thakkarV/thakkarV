I'm a graduate student in the [College of Computing][cc.gatech]
at [Georgia Institute of Technology][gt], advised by [Dr. Rich Vuduc][vuduc].

I work on high performance computing, focusing primarily on accelerated computing and programming models for heterogeneous architectures.
My research helps HPC developers write speed of light applications and kernels that take advantage of modern hardware capabilities in a way that does not make them want to pull their hair out.

My interests mostly lie at the intersection of hardware and software for accelerated computing. I have worked at various hardware shops to this end including [Arm][arm], [Cerebras Systems][cerebras], and [Nvidia][nvidia] on hardware modeling, high performance kernels, and library design. Good folks at Oak Ridge national lab's [OLCF][olcf] remain my long time collaborators on application level projects.

Currently, I work at NVIDIA full time while I finish my PhD. At NVIDIA, I collaborate closely with Cris Cecka from NVR to lead the design of next generation linear algebra libraries, namely, [CUTLASS 3.0][cutlass], a project I have been working on since its inception. I also work on the exposure of next generation tensor core hardware features into the CUDA C++ programming model for peak developer productivity without performance compromises.
