I'm a graduate student in the [College of Computing][cc.gatech]
at [Georgia Institute of Technology][gt], advised by [Dr. Rich Vuduc][vuduc].
Currently, I work at NVIDIA full time while I finish my PhD.
At NVIDIA, I collaborate closely with NVResearch, compiler, GPU arch, and our customers
to lead the design of next generation linear algebra libraries, namely,
[CUTLASS 3.0][cutlass], a project I have been working on since its inception.

Throughout my academic and professional career, my research has focused on the intersection
of programming models for accelerated computing and performance engineering to make GPUs go brrrr.
My research helps HPC developers write speed of light applications and kernels that
take advantage of modern hardware capabilities in a way that does not make them want to pull their hair out.

I was very lucky to get involved at the inception stage of CUTLASS 3.x and work closely with [Cris Cecka][ccekca]
for two years and champion its design and adoption from then on. These days I still work on the CUTLASS C++ project
but but in a much broader capacity. Here are some things I get to do:
- CUTLASS 3.x and beyond
- Tensor core architecture and PTX / CUDA C++ programming model code-sign
- MLIR dialects and compilers for GPU code generation
- Design of new hardware features for future generations of GPUs
- Direct customer assistance for using CUTLASS and targeting tensor cores
- Collaborations with internal and external research teams on publications (FlashAttention 3, fVDB etc.)
- Staffing, project priority and planning, recruiting.

I have also worked at [Arm][arm] and [Cerebras Systems][cerebras] on hardware modeling, high performance kernels, and library design. Good folks at Oak Ridge national lab's [OLCF][olcf] were my collaborators on application level projects during my time at GaTech, who I was lucky to have the honor of sharing two Gordon Bell award nominations with.
