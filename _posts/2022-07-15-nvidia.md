After having worked as an intern for nearly a year and half at NVIDIA, I have decided to join full time as a compute architect in the DL architecture group, in the fast kernels team!

I will continue my collaboration with Cris Cecka from NVR PSA to lead the design of next generation linear algebra library, CUTLASS 3.0, which I will also be basing much of my PhD thesis material on.
